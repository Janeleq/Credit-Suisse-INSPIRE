        <blockquote>History and Science behind Unconscious Bias</blockquote>
        Over the last three decades, our understanding of unconscious bias has evolved. The nature of unconscious bias is well understood, and an instrument (Implicit Association Test) to assess unconscious bias has been developed and rigorously tested.

Here's what we know:

Unconscious biases develop at an early age: biases emerge during middle childhood and appear to develop across childhood (Dore, 2014).
Unconscious biases have real world effects on behavior (Dasgupta, 2004).
Unconscious biases are malleable-one can take steps to minimize the impact of unconscious bias (Dasgupta, 2013; Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2013).
A substantial amount of research has been published demonstrating impact of unconscious bias in various domains including the criminal justice system, education, and health/health care (Kirwan Institute, 2014). Bias may have an impact on: hiring, and mentoring and may contribute to healthcare disparities.
